## Single Variable Calculus

I'm going to use Short Calculus by Serge Lang for doing [Single Variable Calculus](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-0077-9).
I chose this textbook because I didn't want to slog through books that are 1000 pages long. It's only 272 pages.it is 
intended to be a first course in calculus for students with a weak background in mathematics, but it doesn't abandon the 
rigor.

It starts with Numbers and Functions, goes over Graphs and Curves, and after that defines the derivative.
I love how he first gives examples as a stepping stone and then generalizes them. This book is methodical and well written.

Before we dive deep into Single Variable Calculus, we will refresh our Algebra and Trigonometry and also learn Limits from
[Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/). These are some excellent notes for our purpose. Do the 
[Algebra Trig Review](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/AlgebraTrig.aspx) if you need it. 
I would recommend you do [Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/limitsIntro.aspx) up to
[2.9](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Continuity.aspx) from him. 

We can now start working through the book! :)
